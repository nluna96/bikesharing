## Over view of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to better understand NYC citibike data. For this analysis citibike data was used in Tableau, a visulization software to break down the data and analyse trends in a form that many people can understand visualizations. From this analysis we will determine if a similar service will be profitable in other cities.
